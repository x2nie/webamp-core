# Tweet Bot

This "package" is actually a Python script. Originally the [@winampskins](https://twitter.com/winampskins) Twitter bot was a Python script that ran as a cron job. I've since rewritten most of it in JavaScript. The core part that actually talks to the Twitter API is still written in Python. That last remaining code can be found here.

Hopefully it will soon be rewritten in JavaScript.
