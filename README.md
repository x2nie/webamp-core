# Winamp2-js

A reimplementation of Winamp 2.9 in HTML5 and JavaScript.

**As seen on [TechCrunch], [Motherboard], [Gizmodo], Hacker News ([1], [2], [3]), and [elsewhere](./docs/press.md).**

## [Give it a try!](https://webamp.org)

## Use Winamp2-js in your own project

I've tried to make it possible to include Winamp2-js in your own project.

See the [usage documentation](./docs/usage.md) for more information.

## Development

    yarn
    # Or: npm install
    npm start

Open `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/` in your browser.

## Building

    npm install
    npm run build
    npm run serve

Open the local ip/port that is output to the console in your browser.

## Deploying

[Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) runs the build and then pushes the contents of `./built` to the `gh-pages` branch of this repository. GitHub Pages then serve that directory as <https://webamp.org>. CloudFlare sits in front of GitHub pages to provide the SSL certificate.

In short, deploying should be as simple as pushing a commit to master which builds, lints and passes all tests.

### Advanced Usage

There are some "feature flags" which you can manipulate by passing a specially crafted URL hash. Simply supply a JSON blob after the `#` of the URL to change these settings:

* `skinUrl` (string) Url of the default skin to use. Note, this file must be served with the correct Allows Origin header.
* `audioUrl` (string) Url of the default audio file to use. Note, this file must be served with the correct Allows Origin header.
* `hideAbout` (boolean) Selectively hide the byline and GitHub link at the bottom of the page. Useful for taking screenshots.
* `initialState` (object) Override the [initial Redux state](js/reducers.js). Values from this object will be recursively merged into the actual default state.

**Note:** These are intended mostly as development tools and are subject to change at any time.

* [Webamp2x](http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=91850) An
  impressive implementation from 2002(!).

* [JsAmp](http://freecog.net/2005/jsamp/demo/MainWindow.xhtml) An implementation from 2005 by @twm (via [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15317723)).

* [Winamp em HTML5 e Javascript](http://www.tidbits.com.br/winamp-em-html5-e-javascript)
  In 2010 a developer named Danilo posted one of his HTML5 experiments: "an
  audio player simulating good old Winamp". You will have to download the zip
  file.

* [JuicyDrop](http://cggaurav.github.io/juicydrop/) An HTML5 implementation with
  less emphasis on being true to the skin, but fully featured visualizations.
  @cggaurav is keeping it alive on [GitHub](https://github.com/cggaurav/juicydrop)

* [Spotiamp](http://spotiamp.com/) The folks at Spotify reimplemented Winamp as
  a frontend for Spotify. Not in a browser, and only runs on Windows.
