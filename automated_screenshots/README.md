# Automated Screenshots

## Setup

Start Winamp2-js in dev mode:

```
cd winamp2-js
yarn install
npm start
```

```
cd automated_screenshots
yarn install
```

Place skins in `automated_screenshots/skins`. Subdirectories are fine, `.wsz` files will be searched for recursively.

```
npm start
```

Wait...

Find screenshots in `automated_screenshots/screenshots`.
