Hey! Back in February you wrote about my JavaScript version of Winamp (thanks!) and said "The only thing missing is Milkdrop 2.0â€”the visualization plugin that turned music into visual LSD."

Well, I figured I'd let you know that @jberg and I have been working on it for the last few months and we've integrated his WebGL implementation of Milkdrop 2 "Butterchun".

Check it out in Firefox or Chrome: webamp.org

> The only thing is there isn't a music visualiser plugin like the very popular MilkDrop, which turned your illegally downloaded trance MP3s into a trippy feast.
